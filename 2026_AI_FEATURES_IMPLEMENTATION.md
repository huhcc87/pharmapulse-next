# 2026 AI-Driven Features - Implementation Summary

## Status Check

### ✅ Already Implemented:
1. **Audit Logs**: `PosAuditLog` model and utility exist
2. **HSN/GST**: Models and auto-mapping exist
3. **Prescription Models**: Schema exists
4. **DemandForecast Model**: Schema exists (needs implementation)
5. **Basic AI API**: OpenAI integration exists

### ❌ Needs Implementation:
1. **Offline POS** (0% - stub only)
2. **Counter Copilot** (0% - no interaction checking)
3. **Rx OCR** (0% - no OCR pipeline)
4. **Demand Forecasting** (30% - UI exists, needs algorithm)
5. **HSN AI Suggestions** (70% - auto-mapping exists, needs AI layer)

## Implementation Plan

Given the comprehensive nature of these features, I'll implement them systematically. The Prisma schema has been updated with new models. Let me continue with the implementation files.
